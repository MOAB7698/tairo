## ▶️ Getting started

First of all, Thank you so much for purchasing this template and for being our loyal customer. You are awesome! You are entitled to get free lifetime updates to this product and support from the cssninjaStudio team directly. **Tairo** is a product built by [cssninjaStudio](https://cssninja.io/) and [Digisquad](https://digisquad.io/).

### Prerequisites

1. A recent web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, ...)
2. [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(> 18 with pnpm > 8)_ installed
3. Knowledge with [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript) _(should not be installed globally)_
4. Knowledge with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
5. (recommended) [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vue.volar)

#### Install Node.js

1. Check if you already have Node.js installed. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If node is not installed on your machine, you can go to the official nodejs.org website, and choose the version depending on your operating system:

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Install Node.js and npm on Windows, Linux or Mac OSX</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" target="_blank">Or, install Node Version Manager to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js</a>

2. Enable pnpm with corepack

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

> _corepack is installed with node from **v16.13.x**, if your version is below, install it with: `npm install -g corepack`_

To setup the template and start installing project dependencies, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

> **Note:** This will install depenencies form all packages that matches with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. If you need to clear all `node_modules`, you can use `pnpm clear:all` command.

## 🔃 Run a development server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will run the `dev` script from the `package.json` file.

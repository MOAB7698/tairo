Tairo is a premium template sold on [ThemeForest](https://go.cssninja.io/buy-tairo). You have to purchase a license to get access to the source.

Once you own a license, you will be able to download the source from your ThemeForest account. You can also get your [github lifetime access](https://cssninja.io/faq/github-access) from us, which will allow you to get the latest updates, before they're even released on ThemeForest.

title: Get help from our support team
---
When purchasing a license, you get access to our [integrated support portal](https://cssninja.io/faq/support) up to six months after your order. You can ask questions, send your feedback, report bugs and get help from our support team.

Please read the [troubleshooting guide](/documentation/guides/troubleshooting) before asking for help, as it may help you solve your issue faster.

Once your support period is over, we still give you the opportunity to ask questions on our support portal, but we cannot guarantee a response.

In any case, we encourage you to join us on our [discord server](https://go.cssninja/discord), where you can find previous answers to common questions and get help from the community. Feel free to share your feedback, ideas and promote your projects!

title: Prerequisites
---
The template is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You need to have [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. *We do not recommend using the latest version of Node.js as they might introduce breaking changes and produce unexpected results with underlying dependencies.*

```bash
node -v
# v18.x.x
```

:::doc-message{type="muted" icon="lucide:info"}
For windows users, we recommend using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
:::

In addition, we use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager and [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). We use pnpm because it is fast and disk space efficient. It also has a great support for workspaces.  

Workspaces is a feature of pnpm that allows you to manage multiple packages in a single repository (similar to Lerna). We use workspaces to manage the different layers of the template. Each layer is a package that has its own dependencies. Some of them can be disabled to reduce the final and dev bundle sizes.

You can enable pnpm using [corepack](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/corepack.html), which is installed with Node.js.
```bash
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

Then you can check that pnpm is installed and activated.

```bash
pnpm -v
# 8.x.x
```

title: Project overview
---
If you downloaded the source from ThemeForest, you normally have a zip file containing the template. You need to extract the zip file and open a terminal in the extracted folder.

When using the private github repository, you simply need to clone it on your machine and open a terminal in the cloned folder.

In both cases, you should have the same file and folder structure as this:

```bash
├── .app # This is the entry point of your app (main app layer)
├── .demo # This is the entry point of the demo (demo app layer)
├── .vscode # Predefined vscode settings
├── layers # Each layer is a package with its own dependencies
│   ├── documentation
│   ├── landing
│   ├── tairo
│   ├── tairo-layout-collapse
│   └── tairo-layout-sidebar
│   └── tairo-layout-topnav
├── types # Extra typescript definitions
├── # Predefined dotfiles
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.cjs
├── .gitignore
├── .npmrc
├── .nuxtrc
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc
├── # Monorepo configuration files
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── tsconfig.json
```

The collapse layout focuses on a single sidebar with a list of menu links, ideal for smaller apps if you don't have enough content or pages to use a more complex layout like the :doc-linker{to="TairoSidebarLayout"}.

The collapse layout can be folded into an icon sidebar. The collapse layout can have single menu links or submenu links. Clicking on a submenu link will revert the sidebar to its uncollapsed state.
